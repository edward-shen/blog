        <p>I need to make a confession: I finished the magic mirror back in mid-August. I’ll be posting the final update to my mirror whenever I have time (as you can see I am terrible with this concept of blogging), but for now I want to write a post-mortem, to say,...</p>

        <p>I took a break from physically developing my magic mirror (not because the parts aren’t here yet or anything) to work on creating some module that I wanted but didn’t exist. Take, for example, an module that would allow you to view information about a single station in Boston, and...</p>

        <p>Summer has arrived. High school just finished, and I need something to do to fill the time. Why not build a magic mirror? It’s should be relatively cheap, fun, and I get to learn the raspberry pi at the same time. Plus, it shouldn’t take too long to complete (Soon™)....</p>
